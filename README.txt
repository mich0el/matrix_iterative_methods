This program uses iterative methods to solve your system of linear equations (A*x = b) by Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and LU factorization methods.
In file Matrix.txt place your NxN matrix with size on the 1-st row. For example:
  N
  a11 a12 a13 ... a1N
  a21 a22 a23 ... a2N
  .
  .
  .
  aN1 aN2 aN3 ... aNN

In file B.txt place your b vector. For example:
  b1
  b2
  .
  .
  .
  bN
  
In file X.txt you will recieve your solution for vector x.
